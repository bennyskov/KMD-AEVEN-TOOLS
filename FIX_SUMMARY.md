# ITM6AgentUninstall.ps1 - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. CMD Command Not Recognized
**Problem**: Script was using `& cmd /C` but PowerShell couldn't find the `cmd` command.
**Solution**: Changed all instances of `& cmd /C` to `& cmd.exe /C` (21 instances fixed)

### 2. Start Command Parsing Issue
**Problem**: The command `start /WAIT /MIN C:/Windows/Temp/KMD-AEVEN-TOOLS/bin/ITMRmvAll.exe -batchrmvall -removegskit` was failing due to PowerShell parameter parsing issues.
**Solution**:
- Changed from using `Invoke-Expression` to `Start-Process`
- Modified the uninstall command execution to use proper PowerShell cmdlets
- Updated `$global:UninstCmdexec` from complex start command to simple executable path

### 3. File Path and Tool Access Issues
**Problem**: External tools like `handle.exe` and other utilities were not being called properly.
**Solution**: All cmd.exe calls now use full executable path `cmd.exe` ensuring proper resolution.

## Changes Made

### Configuration Changes
```powershell
# OLD:
$global:UninstCmdexec = "start /WAIT /MIN ${UninstPath} -batchrmvall -removegskit"

# NEW:
$global:UninstCmdexec = "`"${UninstPath}`" -batchrmvall -removegskit"
```

### Execution Method Changes
```powershell
# OLD:
$result = Invoke-Expression $cmdString

# NEW:
$process = Start-Process -FilePath "$UninstPath" -ArgumentList "-batchrmvall", "-removegskit" -Wait -PassThru -NoNewWindow
```

### Command Execution Fixes
```powershell
# OLD:
$result = & cmd /C $cmdexec

# NEW:
$result = & cmd.exe /C $cmdexec
```

## Validation Results
- ✅ cmd.exe accessibility confirmed
- ✅ PowerShell script syntax validation passed
- ✅ ITMRmvAll.exe file found in expected location
- ✅ No syntax errors in the updated script

## Expected Improvements
1. **Eliminated "cmd not recognized" errors**: All cmd calls now use explicit cmd.exe
2. **Fixed ITMRmvAll.exe execution**: Now uses Start-Process instead of problematic start command
3. **Better error handling**: More robust external tool execution
4. **Improved file operations**: Handle.exe and other utilities should work correctly

## Remaining Considerations
- Ensure proper permissions for file deletion operations
- Some locked files may still require reboot for complete removal
- Registry cleanup operations should now work more reliably
- External tools (handle.exe, pskill.exe) must be present in the bin directory

## Testing Recommendations
1. Run the script in a test environment first
2. Monitor log output for any remaining errors
3. Verify all ITM components are properly removed
4. Check that registry cleanup operations complete successfully
