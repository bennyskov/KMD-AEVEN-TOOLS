design guide for designing ansible playbooks.
ansible playbooks is in yaml format.
these steps is only to be followes if the file is a .yml or .yaml

**Revised Playbook Task Numbering Rules:**

numbering for this doc at each task begin with "- name:"
- name: '[number].[letter] - top-level Task Name'
- name: '[number].[letter].[number] - within Plays'
- name: '[#1].[#2].[#3] - within Plays'
- name: '[1:99][A-Z].[00:99][letter] - within sub-task or blocks'
- name: '[#1].[#2].[#3][#4] - within sub-task or blocks'
example:
- name: '1.A.0 - Socks tunnel setup'

1.  **Top-Level Play Numbering:**
    *   Each top-level play (defined by `- name:` at indentation level 0) **is numbered**.
    *   The top-level `#1 [Number]` increments sequentially (`1`, `2`, `3`...) for each subsequent top-level play. (not zero-padded) starts at `1`.
    *   The top-level `[Letter]. Descriptive Play Name` (e.g., `1.A - Setup`, `2.B - Install`).
    *   The `[Letter]` starts at 'A' for the first play in the file and increments alphabetically (A -> B -> C...) for each subsequent top-level play.
    *   There is **no third number element** for top-level play names.

2.  **Task Numbering (within Plays):**
    *   Tasks *inside* a play (items under the `tasks:` directive) are numbered using the format `[Number].[Letter].[Number] - Descriptive Task Name`.
    *   The `#1 [Number]` for a task **matches the number of its parent top-level play**.
    *   The `#2 [Letter]` for a task **matches the letter of its parent top-level play**.
    *   The `#3 [Number]` (two digits, zero-padded) starts at `00` for the *first task* within that play.

3.  **Sub-Step Numbering (Optional):**
    *   For tasks that represent sub-steps, error handling, or diagnostic actions directly related to a preceding primary task, you can append a lowercase letter (`a`, `b`, `c`...) to the primary task's full number.
    *   Example: If task `3.C.12` performs an action, related follow-up tasks for error checking or logging could be named `3.C.12a`, `3.C.12b`, etc.
    *   These sub-steps do *not* increment the main `#3 [Number]` sequence. The next *independent* task after `3.C.12` and its sub-steps would be `3.C.13`.

4.  **What to Number:**
    *   Top-level plays.
    *   Standard Ansible tasks (`file`, `shell`, `set_fact`, `debug`, `block`, etc.) within plays.
    *   Named `block:` directives themselves (treated as tasks). Tasks *inside* the block continue the number sequence.
    *   Optionally, sub-steps using the appended letter convention.

5.  **What NOT to Number:**
    *   Tasks that use `include_role:`.

6.  **final iteration - when all above have been executed**
    * check YAML syntax against file and make sure that lines where '- name' is floating somewhare in the line, then it is properly to go to new line.
